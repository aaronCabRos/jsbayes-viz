jsbayes-viz
===========

This JavaScript library is a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) visualization and interaction tool. It is built on the following projects.

* [d3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3)
* [dagre](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre)
* [jsbayes](https://github.com/vangj/jsbayes)

# How do I use jsbayes-viz?

You should only be using this library on the client-side (e.g. with a browser). You may install this library using npm.

`npm install jsbayes-viz --save`

Since there are third party dependencies, you need to reference them in your HTML in the following order. Assuming you have used bower to install the library (and its dependencies), you may reference the libaries as the following.

```
<script src="node_modules/d3/d3.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/lodash/lodash.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/graphlib/dist/graphlib.core.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/dagre/dist/dagre.core.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/jsbayes/jsbayes.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/jsbayes-viz/jsbayes-viz.js"></script>
```

jsbayes is the inference engine, so to use jsbayes-viz, first create a jsbayes graph.

```
var graph = jsbayes.newGraph();
var n1 = graph.addNode('n1', ['t', 'f']);
var n2 = graph.addNode('n2', ['t', 'f']);
var n3 = graph.addNode('n3', ['t', 'f']);
var n4 = graph.addNode('n4', ['t', 'f']);
var n5 = graph.addNode('n5', ['0', '1', '2']);

n2.addParent(n1);
n3.addParent(n2);
n3.addParent(n4);
n5.addParent(n4);

graph.reinit();
graph.sample(10000);
```

Then you create a corresponding jsbayes-viz graph from the jsbayes graph.

```
var g = jsbayesviz.fromGraph(graph);
```

Assuming on your HTML page, you have an SVG element like the following.

```
<svg id="bbn"></svg>
```

Then you can kick off the visualization as follows.

```
jsbayesviz.draw({
  id: '#bbn',
  width: 800,
  height: 800,
  graph: g,
  samples: 15000
});
```

You may also download the samples in JSON or CSV format. To download in JSON format, call the following method. Note the first parameter is the graph (jsbayes-viz graph, *NOT* the jsbayes graph), the second parameter specifies the format (true means JSON and false means CSV), and the last parameter are options. Options are only available for CSV format, namely, to specify row and field delimiters.


```
jsbayesviz.downloadSamples(graph, true, {});
```

An example of downloading samples as CSV is shown below.

```
jsbayesviz.downloadSamples(graph, false, { rowDelimiter: '\n', fieldDelimiter: ',' });
```

# Styling
Each of the SVG components are now associated with a CSS class. You may apply a stylesheet to customize the look and feel of each of these SVG components/elements.

* .node-group : all the elements belonging to a node
* .node-name : the name of a node
* .node-shape : the rectangle that encloses all the elements belonging to a node
* .node-value : the node values
* .node-pct : the node marginal probabilities correspoding to the values
* .node-bar : the belief bars
* .node-iqline : the interquartile lines (e.g. 25%, 50%, 75%)
* .edge-line : the arc between two nodes
* .edge-head : the arrow head at the end of an arc

Here's an example.

```
svg g rect.node-shape { border-radius: 5px; fill:#ffecb3; cursor: move; }
svg g text.node-name { font-weight: 800 }
svg g rect.node-bar { fill: green }
svg g text.node-value { fill:rgb(0,0,0); font-size: 15px; cursor: pointer; }
svg line.edge-line { stroke:rgb(0,0,0) }
svg path.edge-head { fill:rgb(0,0,0) }
```

Or better yet, copy and modify [jsbayes-viz.scss](jsbayes-viz.scss) and modify it to your needs (you will need to generate the corresponding `css` file).

# Some gotcha's
If you have very long string literals as values for the node id/values, then these strings will be truncated to 5 characters at the current moment. Node names are also truncated to 15 characters.

# Unit Testing

To run the unit tests, make sure you have NodeJS and npm installed and type in the following.

```bash
npm install
make
```

# Bower

Install [bower](https://bower.io).

```bash
npm install -g bower
```

Install libraries via bower.

```bash
bower install
```
